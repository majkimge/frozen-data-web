      <p class="normal">
        Frozen data can provide valuable insights into markets, customers, and competitors, which can be used to inform a
        variety of business decisions. By analyzing historical data, businesses can better understand market trends and
        consumer behavior, which can help them make more informed decisions about where to allocate resources, how to
        position themselves in the market, and how to tailor their products and services to meet the needs of their
        customers.
      </p>

      <p class="normal">
        This, in turn, can help with customer retention and overall business growth. Frozen data can also be used to gain
        a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape, which can help businesses stay ahead of the curve and make
        strategic decisions that give them a competitive advantage.

      <p class="normal">
        After creating our graph representation of the transactions we want to use graph neural networks to predict
        where
        new transactions will appear. This can highlight your potential new customers and signal when the existing ones
        are
        most likely to make another transaction.
